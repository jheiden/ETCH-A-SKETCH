This is the readme.md for etch a sketch.

1) Follow the instructions atop Odin’s Google Homepage project to setup a git repository for this project.

2) Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs
a) Create the divs using JavaScript… don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your html file!

b) Best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div (that one can go directly in your html)
c) There are several different ways to make the divs appear as a grid (verses just one on each line) feel free to use any or play with each of them:
float/clear
inline-block
flexbox
CSS Grid

4) Be careful with borders and margins, they can adjust the size of the squares!

5)

Make a box
Make a row
Make the grid
Color the box on MouseEnter
